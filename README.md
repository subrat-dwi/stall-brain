## 🎯 Problem Statement — PS-11

> *"Hazratganj's iconic street market has vendors who over-stock or under-stock daily, leading to waste and lost revenue. Build an agent that reads footfall patterns, weather, local events, and social buzz to recommend optimal daily procurement."*
>
> **Lucknow context:** Hazratganj · Janpath Market

Every morning, thousands of street vendors in Hazratganj make the same high-stakes guess: **how much stock should I buy today?**

They have no tools. They rely on gut feel, last week's memory, and WhatsApp forwards. The consequences are real:

- A vendor overbought potatoes on a rainy day — the crowd never came, the stock rotted.
- The next day, fearing rain again, he bought less — but it was an LSG match day, the streets were packed, and he sold out by 4 PM, losing thousands in revenue.

This isn't bad luck. It's a **data problem**. The signals exist — weather forecasts, event calendars, day-of-week patterns — but no one has put them together for a Hazratganj vendor. Bazaar Brain does exactly that.

---

## 💡 Solution

Bazaar Brain is a **multi-page agentic web app** that acts as a daily procurement advisor for street vendors. A vendor picks their stall type, customizes their item list, and the AI agent synthesizes live weather data, a Lucknow-specific event calendar, and weekly footfall patterns to produce a precise, actionable stock recommendation — in English and Hindi.

The AI doesn't just answer a prompt. It **reasons across multiple data signals** before generating output, making it genuinely agentic rather than a simple chatbot.

---

## ✨ Features

**Stall Profiles**
Seven vendor types built around Lucknow's actual street economy — Chaat Stall, Chai Tapri, Juice Corner, Flower Vendor, Bhutta Stall, Snacks & Namkeen, and Balloon Seller — each with pre-loaded default inventory.

**Editable Inventory**
Vendors can add, remove, or rename items in their stall list before forecasting. The AI uses only the vendor's actual items — no generic suggestions.

**Live Lucknow Weather**
Fetches real-time weather from Open-Meteo using Hazratganj's exact coordinates (26.85°N, 80.95°E) and maps conditions to footfall impact multipliers. Rain doesn't just mean "bad weather" — it means 0.4x footfall for chaat but a boost for bhutta.

**Lucknow Event Radar**
A built-in calendar of local events — Lucknow Mahotsav, Navratri, IPL LSG home matches at Ekana, public holidays, and weekly footfall patterns — feeds into the demand calculation before the AI ever sees the prompt.

**Demand Multiplier Engine**
Before calling the LLM, the system computes:

```
Demand Multiplier = Weather Impact × Event Impact × Day-of-Week Pattern
```

This structured signal is passed to the model, grounding the AI output in real numbers rather than vibes.

**Bilingual Output**
Every forecast is available in English and Hindi (Devanagari), because a tool is only useful if the vendor can actually read it.

**Forecast History & Feedback**
Past forecasts are stored locally. Vendors can mark predictions as accurate or not, creating a personal accuracy log over time.

## 🗺️ App Flow

```
Landing Page  →  Setup Page  →  Forecast Page
(welcome +        (pick stall      (live signals +
 how it works)     + edit items)    AI output)
```

The app is structured across three pages with a clear stepper, ensuring vendors always know where they are and what to do next.
